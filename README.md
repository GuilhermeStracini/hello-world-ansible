# Hello World Ansible

ðŸ“š A repository to explore and learn **[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)**, a powerful open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task orchestration.

---

## Overview

This repository provides hands-on examples to get started with Ansible, focusing on:

- Writing and testing **playbooks** for automation tasks.
- Understanding and creating **inventories** for target systems.
- Exploring integrations with tools like Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

Ansible enables infrastructure automation with a simple and agentless architecture, making it ideal for system administrators and DevOps engineers.

---

## Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**:
  - Step-by-step examples for setting up and running Ansible.
  - Basic playbooks for common automation tasks.

- **Advanced Use Cases**:
  - Demonstrates integration with tools like **Docker** and **Terraform**.
  - Includes examples for CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure orchestration.

- **Testing with Docker**:
  - Learn how to test Ansible playbooks locally using Docker containers.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use Ansible locally.

### Prerequisites

- Install **Ansible**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
- Optionally, install **Docker** if testing playbooks in a containerized environment: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeStracini/hello-world-ansible.git
   cd hello-world-ansible
   ```

2. **Set Up an Inventory**:
   - Create or edit an inventory file to define your target systems.
   - Learn more: [Getting Started with Inventories](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_inventory.html).

3. **Run a Playbook**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
   ```

4. **Test with Docker** (Optional):
   - Use Docker containers as target systems for testing:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i docker_inventory.yml playbook.yml
     ```
